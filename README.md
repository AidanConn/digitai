# DigitAI

DigitAI is a web application enabling users to explore AI and handwritten digit recognition. Utilizing PyTorch, users can draw digits on an HTML canvas. Upon submission, DigitAI employs a CNN model, created using PyTorch, to predict the drawn digit, offering insights into modern machine learning.

## Features

- **Intuitive Drawing Interface**: Users can effortlessly draw digits using a mouse or touchpad directly on the canvas.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Instantly receive predictions for the drawn digit with high accuracy.
- **Educational Experience**: Gain insights into neural network technology and PyTorch implementation while exploring DigitAI.
- **Customizable and Open Source**: DigitAI's codebase is open for exploration and customization, offering endless possibilities for further development and learning.
